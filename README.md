Functionality Breakdown
1. Hamburger Menu (script.js)

hamburger.addEventListener('click', () => {
    navLinks.classList.toggle('active');
    hamburgerIcon.style.display = navLinks.classList.contains('active') ? 'none' : 'block';
    closeIcon.style.display = navLinks.classList.contains('active') ? 'block' : 'none';
});

2. Contact Popup (script.js)
contactLink.addEventListener('click', function() {
    popup.style.display = 'flex';
});

closePopup.addEventListener('click', function() {
    popup.style.display = 'none';
});

3. Chatbot (script.js)
The chatbot is powered by predefined responses mapped to specific keywords. The chatbot detects the user’s input and provides a relevant response based on the keywords. Emojis can also be added to the conversation by selecting from an emoji picker.

Sending a Message:
When the user sends a message, it is displayed in the chat window, and a corresponding bot response is triggered.
document.getElementById('send-message').addEventListener('click', sendMessage);

Bot Response Matching:
The bot matches keywords in the user’s input and provides a response.
function getBotResponse(userInput) {
    for (const category in chatbotResponses) {
        const { keywords, response } = chatbotResponses[category];
        if (keywords.some(keyword => userInput.includes(keyword.toLowerCase()))) {
            return response;
        }
    }
    return chatbotResponses["default"].response;
}

4. Emoji Picker (script.js)
The emoji picker appears when the emoji button is clicked. The user can select an emoji, which is then appended to the user’s message.
document.getElementById('emoji-icon').addEventListener('click', function() {
    const emojiPicker = document.getElementById('emoji-picker');
    emojiPicker.style.display = emojiPicker.style.display === 'block' ? 'none' : 'block';
});
